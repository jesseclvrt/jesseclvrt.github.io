Most people know that you should have a strong password. The problem is that humans are not very creative. Even skilled users will reuse the same password over and over, or do predictable variations of their complex password. This is not a problem short-term; a strong password can prevent someone from bruteforcing their way into your account. However, that’s not actually how most passwords are stolen.Most account takeovers start with a data breach of some company. An attacker manages to exfiltrate username and password combinations, stored unhashed, because companies that allow gigabytes of data to be exfiltrated are liable to make other poor security decisions like that. Attackers share this list around and attempt to reuse these credentials on other websites. This is also called a credential stuffing attack.The reason this is so effective is because of numerous factors, password reuse being one. Users may not be aware of breaches occurring; in fact, there have been many instances of unscrupulous companies who downplay the severity of a breach or never disclosing. Even if the company does make the ethical choice and disclose, there is no guarantee users get the news or changes their password. Unfortunately, many people may only change their password for just the breached service, and not any accounts that share a password. Finally, even if a user understands the risk of shared passwords, they must enumerate every account they have using the same password and then individually update each account. Nowadays, almost every site we visit has a login. There are numerous places to consider. Social media, banking, forums, work accounts, utility companies, phone app accounts, gaming accounts, store-specific accounts… how many accounts do YOU have?). If you are a chronic password reuser, then you may literally have to update every account you use.By my measure, password reuse is the biggest security problem facing the typical internet user. Other than being a superhuman that can memorize 10+ password “phrases/acronyms” (don’t even get me started on that xkcd comic, you know the one), there are two popular approaches to fixing password reuse; I have issues with both solutions. These solutions are password managers and two-factor authentication.Password ManagersA great idea. You only have one master password that gives you access to all of your other passwords. Not only are you incentivized to make a strong password, managers also come with utilities that make your other passwords strong and unique. I love the idea of a password manager. Unfortunately, they have many shortcomings. The first issue is most are not free. And although the price is relatively small (a few dollars a month), it can be a barrier of entry for some. Free tiers are sparse and very limited.Password managers have an issue with flexibility. I like having the ability to say “I don’t like how this service changed, and I am taking my business elsewhere.” Password manager services do not make this easy. I hate being locked into a service. Beyond the obvious hurdle of migrating all of your passwords, the most affordable password managers have year-long subscriptions you are tempted to buy into for savings.And aren’t we back where we started? Now we have a company that, if breached, the attacker will have access to all of your accounts. You would obviously hope that a cybersecurity business would be more secure than your average shop, but this is not easily verified. Even if you do have faith in their security, a password manager company looks absolutely appealing to gain access to. Password manager companies likely see significantly more attacks than the average company, and which increases the odds for an attack to be successful.There are DIY, free password managers, but I found many of them extremely unattractive compared to SAAS alternatives. The biggest issue is platform compatibility. These SAAS companies have the resources to absolutely dominate DIY password managers in this area. Desktop or mobile, whatever browser, where ever you are, you can almost guarantee that you can access their service. The same can not be said with many FOSS password manager projects, which may only be a desktop program, browser extension, etc.Lastly, I would consider it unwise to put all of your security into one password. One master password for all accounts is not a sound plan, and it sounds suspiciously like the original problem we faced. It also makes for a rather attractive brute-forcing target. This is naturally remedied by…Two-Factor AuthenticationThis is based around the idea that you should show two forms of ID before you are authenticated. There are three forms of authentication: something you know (knowledge), something you have (possession), or something you are (biometric). A password represents something you know. The second factor should be something you have, because biometric authentication is inherently flawed. Today, the most popular second factor is your phone. Possession of the phone is verified by a code sent in a text message.Many ads and talk about SMS 2FA like it is a panacea for cybersecurity. Right, as if nobody has ever stolen a phone before. A crook likely won’t need to unlock it, because SMS codes are very often displayed loud and proud as a banner text message alert.It sounds somewhat unrealistic that a thief tracks you down and steals your phone to access your bank account, so let’s bring it back to the average user who got caught up in a data breach. Even then you are not safe when using SMS 2FA.For those unaware, a popular scam has emerged called a SIM swap. Scammers call up your phone provider and impersonate you or someone close to you. “I switched carriers! Please transfer my number to my new SIM card.” The carrier may do so without authentication steps. Now the attacker uses their SIM card to receive your SMS messages without access to your phone.So SMS 2FA is not the cure-all it was promised to be, but are there alternatives? Email is another popular method, but how do you authenticate to email? Usually by password and SMS 2FA. Google uses this method by default. We are back to square one and have only kicked the problem down the line.A Quick Word on OAuth and EmailAlthough OAuth is used for authorization, not authentication, I feel it is important to mention because it has some parallel issues with to password managers, master passwords, and 2FA. When you click “Log in using…”, you are agreeing to defer authentication to your chosen authentication provider (Google, Twitter, Facebook, etc.) This could represent a single point of failure for all of your accounts, like the techniques discussed before. Email must be your most secure account, because it can be used for both 2FA and OAuth. Nowadays, it seems like Google/Gmail is our universal account for the internet.ConclusionAuthentication, at least how we approach it, is broken. Luckily, there is a way to remedy most of the issues discussed here by combining the two methods. In my next post, I will explain how I secure my accounts using Keepass and Yubikey." } ]
